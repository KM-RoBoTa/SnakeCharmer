# Snake Charmer
_**The Graphical User Interface for Modular Snake Robot (Lola-OP)**_

Snake charming is the ancient art of controlling snakes through music* and body movement. This program offers a modern rendition of snake charming of modular snake robots (Lola-OP, Dynamixel AX-12A actuators) through a graphical interface.

Details on the graphical user interface can be found in the user guide (UserGuide.pdf).

*Disclaimer: Like how snake charming does not really depend on music, our Snake Charmer program does not control the snake robots through music or soundwaves. However, you may play some music while controlling the snake robots, in the spirit of the snake charming practice.
